const aiGeneratedData = `1. **Hello World**: The most basic Python program.

\`\`\`python
print("Hello, world!")
\`\`\`

2. **Adding two numbers**:
This simple program adds two inputted numbers together and prints the result.

\`\`\`python
num1 = 3
num2 = 5

result = num1 + num2

print(result)
\`\`\`

3. **Using Functions**: Below we have a function that calculates the square of a number.

\`\`\`python
def square(number):
    return number * number

print(square(4))
\`\`\`

4. **Print numbers from 1 to 10**:

\`\`\`python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
\`\`\`

5. **Simple if-else Statement**:
This program checks whether a user-inputted number is even or odd.

\`\`\`python
number = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
if number % 2 == 0:
   print(f"{number} is even.")
else:
   print(f"{number} is odd.")
\`\`\`

6. **List and Loop**:

This program creates a list of names, prints each name individually.

\`\`\`python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
for name in names:
    print(name)
\`\`\`

7. **Dictionary Example**: Python uses dictionary for key-value pairs.

\`\`\`python
student_grades = {"John": 90, "Mary": 85, "Tom": 92}
print(student_grades["John"])
\`\`\`

Remember that these are very basic examples and there is a vast range of more complex programs you can write in Python. These simple examples are the foundation upon which all other
programming skills are built.`
